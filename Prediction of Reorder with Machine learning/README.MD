###  Prediction of Reorder with Machine Learning Models

# Overview

- This project offers a machine learning-based solution for analysing and predicting inventory Reorder based on feature which can used in the stock inventory tool to automate the inventory reorder with the user input for the feature columns and there by provide a notification to user that a reorder is required or not for that inventory and thereby  reduce the human error. This carried out using the dataset titled "Inventory List as at 2022" and the project can be implemented in either of the format based on user compatibility:
•	Python script: machine_learning.py
•	Jupyter Notebook: machine_learning.ipynb
Both files contain the same logic but are provided in different formats to accommodate various working environments.

# Key Features:

• Data Pre-processing: Cleaning and preparing the inventory data.
• Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) for inventory trend predictions.
• Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
• Data Visualisation: Visual representation of data and model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project ("Inventory List as at 2022") is **private** and is not included in the repository due to confidentiality reasons.

If you need access to the dataset, please contact kaushik.r277@gmail.com to request access. Alternatively, you can use your own dataset with a similar structure.

# Installation

- Required Libraries
- Here are the necessary libraries, which can be installed either in Google Colab or locally using pip.
	• pandas
	• numpy
	• matplotlib
	• scikit-learn:
	• seaborn (optional, for advanced visualisations)
	• openpyxl (for reading Excel files)

								________________________________________


# Install the Libraries (Colab or Local)

* For Google Colab:
	!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn openpyxl

* For local setup, run the following command in your terminal:
	pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn openpyxl

Note: openpyxl is required for reading Excel files with pandas.

# Running the Project in Google Colab

* Step 1: Upload Files to Google Colab
	1. Open Google Colab.
	2. Upload the necessary files (machine_learning.ipynb or machine_learning.py and the dataset Inventory List as at 2022.xlsx).
	3. Use the file upload feature in Colab to ensure all files are available for use in the environment.

* Step 2: Install Required Libraries
	Ensure the required libraries are installed using the appropriate Colab commands to import pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and openpyxl for Excel file support.

* Step 3: Load the Excel Dataset
	Once the dataset is uploaded, load the Excel data using pandas. Be sure the dataset path is correctly referenced based on the Colab environment.

* Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script
	• If you're working with the Jupyter Notebook, simply execute the cells sequentially to follow the entire machine learning workflow.
	• If you're working with the Python script, you can execute it after uploading using Colab's built-in command execution feature.

# Running the Project Locally

* Step 1: Clone or Download Files
	Download the following files to your local machine:
		• machine_learning.py
		• machine_learning.ipynb
		• The dataset: Inventory List as at 2022.xlsx
	Ensure the files are placed in the same working directory.

* Step 2: Install Required Libraries
	Using your terminal or command prompt, install the necessary Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and openpyxl for Excel support) via pip.

* Step 3: Run the Python Script or Notebook
	• If using the Python script, navigate to the directory containing the script and dataset, then execute the script.
	• If using the Jupyter Notebook, open it in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter, VSCode) and run the cells sequentially.

- Ensure that the dataset path is correct for loading the Excel file in your local environment

	o Handle missing values, normalise features, and possibly encode categorical variables.

3. Model Training:
	o Train machine learning models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.

4. Model Evaluation:
	o Evaluate model performance using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Accuracy, depending on the problem.

5. Data Visualisation:
	o Visualise the results using matplotlib and other libraries to compare predicted vs. actual results.
